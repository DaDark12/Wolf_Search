# Wolf Search — Privacy Policy

- Wolf Search is a self-hosted search engine. You control the hosting and the data.
- **We do not collect, log, or sell any personal data.** No analytics, no tracking cookies, no user profiling.
- Queries are processed in-memory and returned to the requester. The server does not store queries long-term.
- If you host Wolf Search on a public server, standard server/network logs (e.g., your host provider's access logs) may still exist separately. To maintain a zero-data policy, configure your host to minimize or disable access logging.
- To run privately: host on your local machine / local network or on a VPS you control, and do not add analytics scripts.
